## 📖 Overview  
The Bugesera AgroHydro Explorer is an interactive GIS tool built for Track 4: GIS Innovative Challenge of the **NISR 2025 Big Data Hackathon.  

It addresses the challenge of building spatial sampling frames for agricultural survey data collection in **Season C crop production within Bugesera District, Rwanda.  

This solution empowers policymakers, agricultural planners, and survey teams with real-time suitability mapping, geospatial stratification, and automated sampling frames, enabling evidence-based agricultural planning.

## 🎯 Hackathon Alignment  

- Track: 4 – GIS Innovative Challenge  
- Challenge: Build a spatial sampling frame for agricultural survey data collection (Season C).  
- Theme: Agricultural transformation & food security.  
- Alignment: Direct contribution to Rwanda’s NST1/NST2 priorities on food security and digital innovation.

## 📊 The Challenge & Our Solution  

### The Problem  
- ❌ Reliance on administrative boundaries ignores spatial variability.  
- ❌ Inefficient irrigation investments.  
- ❌ Missed opportunities for Season C production.  
- ❌ Limited evidence-based agricultural planning.  

### Our Solution  
- ✅ Geospatial stratification using slope, water availability & temperature.  
- ✅ Interactive dashboard for real-time suitability analysis.  
- ✅ Automated spatial sampling (100 stratified points).  
- ✅ Field-ready exports (CSV, visual maps).  
- ✅ Scalable to other districts & seasons.

## ✨ Key Features  

### 🗺️ Interactive Mapping  
- Multi-layer visualization: Water, Rivers, Temperature, Slope, Suitability.  
- Satellite base maps with high-resolution imagery.  
- Click-to-analyze any location for suitability scores.  
- Intuitive color-coded legends for classification.  

### 📊 Advanced Analytics  
- Water extent analysis (2017 vs 2024).  
- Land Surface Temperature (LST) monitoring.  
- Slope suitability for irrigation planning.  
- 5-class adaptive suitability classification.  

### 🎯 Decision Support  
- **Weighted Overlay Analysis:**  
  - Slope (40%)  
  - River proximity (35%)  
  - Land Surface Temperature (25%)  
- **Automated sampling frame:** 100 points, 20 per class.  
- **Download-ready CSV outputs** for field surveys.  

### 📈 Data Visualization & Export  
- Interactive **charts** for water & temperature trends.  
- **Real-time statistics** for each suitability class.  
- Export options: **CSV, Google Drive, and maps.**

## 🔬 Methodology  

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis  
```javascript
// Weighted Overlay Formula
var suitability = slopeFilled.multiply(0.4)        // Slope (40%)
  .add(riverFilled.multiply(0.35))                // River Proximity (35%)
  .add(LSTfilled.multiply(0.25));                 // Temperature (25%)
```

### Classification Scheme  
| Class | Score Range | Description                  | Color        | Area % |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| 1     | 0.0–0.2     | Permanently not suitable     | 🟤 Maroon    | ~0.28%   |
| 2     | 0.2–0.4     | Temporarily not suitable     | 🔴 Red       | ~6.10%   |
| 3     | 0.4–0.6     | Marginally suitable          | 🟡 Yellow    | ~86.08%   |
| 4     | 0.6–0.8     | Moderately suitable          | 🟢 Light Green | ~2.69%   |
| 5     | 0.8–1.0     | Highly suitable              | 🟢 Dark Green | ~15.49%   |
